# npm-business-card-eyadkobatte

Display a business card with my details. [Inspired by Max Stoiber from this tweet](https://twitter.com/mxstbr/status/1200358955811295233)

The goal for this is to try and not use any dependencies other than devDependencies like eslint and prettier.

It would be a personal goal to have 0 dependencies in the end.

## Using this package

run `npx @eyadkobatte/card` to get my details out in your terminal
